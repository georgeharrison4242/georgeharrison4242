Hi, I'm George Harrison
=======================

No, not the Beatle. 

Yes, the computer science student at Oxford University.

Why am I here, I don't hear you ask? Well, I graduate in summer 2022, I am looking for a technology-based grad-scheme, 
and this seems like a good place to showcase a couple of projects I've worked on.

What can I do? Program! More specifically? I'd be comfortable in any OO language, really. I prefer backend to frontend despite being partial to a quick-and-easy-python-frontend.
Python is my comfort language.

Thanks for reading!
